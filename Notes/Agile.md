# Intro to Agile

As a team becomes more fluent with agile, more DevOps becomes essential (the more relevent your skills become). 

If agile is done correctly it should help focus and productivity. 

## 4 core values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 
- Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
- Responding to change over following a plan. 


Agile is a way of thinking- philosophy. 
The essence of agile- People oriented not process oriented. 
More flexible than waterfall model.

Agile can work to a predictive deadline- forecasting. Just have to cut out some work.

Agile helping software crisis- Software is actually working instead of just documentation. 

## Scrum
Scrum is an agile methodology. 
- Daily standups- short questions e.g what did you do yesterday, plans for today, any blockers.
- Sprints- e.g every 2 weeks go through the framework. Sprint reviews (Reviewing backlogs and sprints). Sprint retrospective (what went well as a team and what you could improve).


## Agile Fluency Model:
- Focusing= team just trying to learn the basics. DevOps is not essential but helpful to have.
- Delivering= Team always has software ready to ship at any time. Very agile. DevOps is essential. 
- Optimizing= DevOps essential. 
- Strengthening= DevOps essential.

Agile is not always best for a company. It depends on the culture of the company. 

The company needs to be willing to invest and pay for the agile approach to be implemented.
