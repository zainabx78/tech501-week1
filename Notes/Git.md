# Git

* Saves versions of files/folders.
* Tracks changes.

## Git repository (Repo)
* Just a normal folder/directory at the beginning.
* Use git init to turn the folder into a git repository.

### Changing the name of the master branch
* Use [git branch -M main] to change the name of the master branch to main. 
## 3 States of Git
1. Modified (same as untracked) - This shows the file as red when git status command is ran.
2. Staged (same as tracked and added to index) - This shows the file as green when git status command is ran. To get a file to this stage, need to run [git add .]
3. Committed - To get a file to this stage, need to run [git commit -m "message"]. This Shows the "status as working tree clean"
