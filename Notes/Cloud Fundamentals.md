# Cloud Intro

### Cloud service models:
- **IAAS**- Your responsibility is OS, middleware, runtime, applications and data. E.g EC2, VMs, bare metal servers. 
- **PaaS**- Your responsibility is applications and data. E.g AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service.
- **SaaS**- Responsibility= Data. E.g. microsoft 365.

# What is the cloud
- Centrally managed.
  - Remote servers hosted on the internet.
  - Stores, manages and processes data.
  - Allows users to access computing resources (storage, applications and databases).

  

How do we know if something is in the cloud? Differences between on-prem and the cloud? 
- Infrastructure- On prem has physical hardware, cloud clients don't. 
- Pay-as-You-Go Model: Cloud clients are billed monthly or based on usage.
- Scalability and Elasticity: Cloud can dynamically scale resources unlike on prem.
- Doesn't rely on local servers= in the cloud.


The 4 deployment models of cloud: private vs public vs hybrid vs multi-cloud - Differences? How do they work? 
- Private cloud= dedicated to a single organization.
  - Hosted either on prem or 3rd party.
  - Offers full control over resources and data.
- Public cloud= shared environments via virtualization where resources are available over the internet.
- Hybrid cloud= Combination of private and public clouds.
  - Organizations use a private cloud for sensitive operations and a public cloud for less critical workloads
- Multi-cloud= Use of multiple clouds simultaneously. 


What are the advantages/disadvantages of the cloud? (Particularly for a business) 
- Advantages= Cost saving, scalable and flexible, disaster recovery, enhanced security.
- Disadvantages= Dependent on internet connection, limited control, compliance challenges, unpredictable costs.
  
 Difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud 
  - CapEx (Capital Expenditure) involves large, upfront investments in physical assets (e.g., servers, hardware) that are depreciated over time. These are long-term, one-time costs.
  - OpEx (Operational Expenditure) refers to ongoing, recurring costs for day-to-day operations (e.g., cloud subscriptions, salaries). These costs are expensed in the year incurred, making them more flexible and predictable.
  - Cloud computing shifts IT spending from CapEx to OpEx, allowing businesses to pay for resources on a subscription or usage basis.
  - This reduces upfront costs and offers greater flexibility, as businesses can scale resources easily without large capital investments.

Is migrating to the cloud always cheaper? 
  - Initial migration costs (e.g., setup, training, downtime) can be high.
  - for consistent high usage, cloud services can be more expensive than on-premises solutions.
  - data transfer fees and vendor lock-in can increase costs over time.

Marketshare - What is the breakdown? Add a diagram to help understand marketshare trends 
- AWS: 31%
- Microsoft Azure: 20%
- Google Cloud: 11%
- Others (Alibaba, IBM, Oracle, etc.): ~38%


What are the 3 largest Cloud providers known for (What makes them popular?) 
- AWS- It is known for being highly reliable and providing solutions for computing, storage, machine learning, AI, and analytics​
- Azure- Azure is favored for its enterprise integrations with Microsoft products, making it ideal for businesses that already use software like Windows Server and Office 365. Its hybrid cloud capabilities are also a major draw.
- Google cloud- Google Cloud is recognized for its strong data analytics and machine learning tools, such as BigQuery and TensorFlow, making it a top choice for businesses focused on innovation, big data, and AI. It also excels in container management via Kubernetes​

Which cloud provider do you think might be the best? Why? 
- AWS- long standing reputation, global infrastructure, dominance in cloud market. 

What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?
-  Compute capacity, data transfer fees, security, database queries.

What are the 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud? 
- Collaboration focuses on breaking down silos between teams, which is facilitated by cloud tools for remote work and shared resources.
- Automation streamlines repetitive tasks, and the cloud provides resources like CI/CD tools and serverless platforms to automate development pipelines.
- CI/CD enables continuous delivery and integration of software, with cloud platforms offering tools like AWS CodePipeline and Azure DevOps to automate the build and deployment processes. 
- Monitoring and Feedback ensures real-time system insights, supported by cloud services such as AWS CloudWatch and Google Stackdriver to track performance and make improvements.
